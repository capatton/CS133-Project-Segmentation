I'm doing the image segmentation application.

Profile results:

Execution times
I charted execution times on three of the data files:

flower.dat
1 iteration Execution Time: .018s
2 iteration Execution Time: .018s
4 iteration Execution Time: .022s
8 iteration Execution Time: .028s
16 iteration Execution Time: .036s
124 iteration Execution Time: .190s
1000 iteration Execution Time: 2.002s
5000 iteration Execution Time: 10.347s
12000 iteration Execution Time: 25.02s

chest.dat
1 iteration Execution Time: .015s
2 iteration Execution Time: .016s
4 iteration Execution Time: .018s
8 iteration Execution Time: .022s
16 iteration Execution Time: .031s
124 iteration Execution Time: .132s
1000 iteration Execution Time: 1.244s
5000 iteration Execution Time: 7.402s
12000 iteration Execution Time: 18.021s

phantom.dat
1 iteration Execution Time: .013s
2 iteration Execution Time: .018s
4 iteration Execution Time: .020s
8 iteration Execution Time: .026s
16 iteration Execution Time: .035s
124 iteration Execution Time: .220s
1000 iteration Execution Time: 2.068
5000 iteration Execution Time: 10.328s
12000 iteration Execution Time: 24.793s

I reviewed the code to look for bottlenecks/time complexities:
For loop on lines 24-32 has O(n * m) complexity (n = rows, m = columns)
For loop on lines 33-90 has O(I * n * m) (I = iterations)
For loop on lines 91-98 has O(n * m)
Program has a total time complexity of O(I * n * m)

Main bottle neck is the for loop from lines 33-90.  


Parallelizable parts of the code:
Some of the initialization code in the beginning can be parallelized into tasks
Double for loop lines 24-32 is parallelizable (no shared memory that's written to)
Double for loop lines 40-51 is parallelizable (no shared memory that's written to)
Double for loop lines 56-76 is parallelizable (no shared memory that's written to)
Three for loops from 77-90 can be parallelized
Double for loop from 91-98 is parallelizable
