I'm doing the image segmentation application.

Implementation:
I just stuck "#pragma omp parallel for" statements everywhere they could go. I was able to parallelize 6 different for loops and cut the speed a pretty good amount on large iteration amounts.  However, because of the overhead, there wasn't always an improvement on low iteration test cases.

Execution times
I charted execution times on three of the data files:
