I'm doing the image segmentation application.

Implementation:
I initialized MPI inside of the seg_main.c function, and then parallelized things inside of the segmentation.c function. In order to parallelize,
I divided up the "countour" float and had each process calculate a section of the array.  After everything returned, inside of seg_main.c, I did a 
join on all the processes.

Execution times
I charted execution times on three of the data files:
