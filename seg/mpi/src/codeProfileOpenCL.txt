I'm doing the image segmentation application.

Implementation:
I did everything inside of the segmentation.c file.  I started the code with a clGetPlatformIDs call.  I then allocated space
for all the platforms, filled in the platforms, retreived the number of devices, and then used buffers and the kernel to parallelize the code.

Execution times
I charted execution times on three of the data files:
